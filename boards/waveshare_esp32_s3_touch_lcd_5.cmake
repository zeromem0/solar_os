# Port: RGB display (through CH422G expander bring-up), RTC, SD, UART,
# connectivity, GT911 touch (polled app-level driver, see
# drivers/touch_gt911.cmake). No RS485. USB native CDC and UART are
# both wired as console/shell candidates; UART lives on GPIO15/16,
# the board's stock CAN pins (TJA1051 TXD/RXD) -- this only becomes a
# real point-to-point serial port once that transceiver is swapped for
# a MAX232 on the hardware side, which drops CAN support in exchange.
#
# BLE capability stays ON -- solar_os_ble_keyboard.c's functions are
# called unconditionally (not #if-guarded) from several shell files
# (setterm keyboard/keyrate, exit-key reading, TUI settings) that every
# other board has always had BLE for, so turning the capability off
# outright breaks the link. What's actually broken (see the SKIP_INIT
# comment in the board header) is calling solar_os_ble_keyboard_init()
# itself, which hangs boot indefinitely -- confirmed by a clean serial
# capture that stops dead partway through BLE bring-up, well past that
# code's own 5s internal timeout, on every boot. It runs synchronously
# inside init_peripherals(), before the UART/CDC fallback shell starts,
# so it was taking the whole board down with it, not just BLE itself.
