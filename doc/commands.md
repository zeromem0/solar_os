# SolarOS Shell Commands

This document covers built-in shell commands. Foreground applications are
documented separately in [apps.md](apps.md). Command availability depends on the
compiled firmware flavor and board capabilities; `help` shows the commands in
the running image.

## Shell Conventions

Paths are resolved relative to the current shell directory. The default storage
volume is presented as `/`. On SD-backed boards, the primary SD card volume also
has the internal mount path `/sdcard`, and the internal flash volume is mounted
at `/flash`. On boards without SD support, internal flash is mounted as `/`.

Wildcard patterns are supported by selected filesystem commands, for example
`*.txt`.

Tab completion covers commands, subcommands, filesystem paths, job names, port
names, and stream IDs where the command exposes enough structure.

History is kept in memory and cached at `/.shell/history` when storage is
available. Optional startup and alias files:

```text
/.shell/startup
/.shell/alias
/.shell/user
/.shell/hostname
```

`/.shell/startup` runs once per boot on the first startup-enabled shell. Shell
sessions created by that script do not run it again.

The display-shell app exit chord is `CTRL+ALT+DEL`. Port shells use `Ctrl+]`.

## Shell Control

| Command | Usage | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `help` | `help` | List built-in shell commands. |
| `clear` | `clear` | Clear the active shell terminal. |
| `watch` | `watch [-n seconds] <command> [args...]` | Repeat another shell command until `Esc`, `q`, or the app-exit key is pressed. |
| `sh` | `sh <file>` | Run a simple SolarOS shell script from storage. |
| `reboot` | `reboot` | Restart the board. |
| `sessions` | `sessions` | List display app sessions, display shell sessions, and port shell sessions. |
| `fg` | `fg <session-id>` | Resume a display app or display shell session. |
| `close` | `close <session-id>` | Close a display app or display shell session, or stop a port shell session. |
| `inbox` | `inbox` | Open the universal incoming-message browser. |
| `inbox` | `inbox status` | Show universal incoming-message counts and storage status. |
| `inbox` | `inbox list [all\|unread]` | List newest messages first. |
| `inbox` | `inbox read <id>` | Print one message and mark it read. |
| `inbox` | `inbox clear` | Remove every message. |
| `inbox` | `inbox post <source> <message>` | Post a message from a shell script or for testing. |
| `email` | `email` | Open the receive-only email app. |
| `email` | `email status` | Show saved account, local message counts, and last sync error. |
| `email` | `email configure <imaps://host[:port]> <user> <password> [mailbox]` | Save an IMAPS account; the default mailbox is `INBOX`. |
| `email` | `email sync` | Start a one-shot mailbox synchronization. |
| `email` | `email forget` | Remove the saved account and local email list. |
| `pocsag` | `pocsag status` | Show POCSAG receiver configuration, counters, correction statistics, and RSSI. |
| `pocsag` | `pocsag send <radio> <frequency-hz> <baud> <ric> <message> [alpha\|numeric] [normal\|inverted] [function]` | Encode and transmit one POCSAG page. |

Sessions are foreground application state plus shell instances attached to a
display target or byte-stream port. Background services such as log followers,
SLIP, DAQ, and HTTP serving are jobs and are controlled with `job`.

Scripts are intentionally simple. `sh` skips blank lines and lines whose first
non-space character is `#`, then executes each remaining line as a normal shell
command. There are no variables, pipes, redirects, or conditionals yet.

Aliases are stored in `/.shell/alias`, one per line:

```text
name command-or-app fixed-args...
```

Arguments typed after the alias are appended.

The inbox is a persistent, producer-neutral message sink. Radio decoders,
background chat or mail jobs, and shell scripts publish messages with a source,
optional topic/sender/title, priority, timestamp, and body. New messages are
unread by default. The status bar shows an envelope and unread count; reading or
clearing messages durably updates that count. The newest 64 messages are kept in
PSRAM when available and mirrored by a fixed-size ring at
`/.inbox/messages.bin`; its compiled maximum is below 32 KB, so systems using
the 64 KB internal flash volume cannot grow the inbox without bound. Replayed
mail and chat notifications retain their existing read state. The browser shows
newest messages first; opening a message marks the shared entry read.

Email configuration is saved in NVS and deliberately has no compiled remote
server or account default. Only `imaps://` endpoints are accepted, with TLS
certificate validation enabled. Use a provider-specific app password where
available. The password is supplied as a shell argument and stored with the
device configuration, so treat shell history and physical access to the device
as sensitive. `email sync` performs one synchronization; use the `email-sync`
job for periodic polling.

## System And Diagnostics

| Command | Usage | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | `version` | Print the SolarOS version and firmware flavor. |
| `pkg` | `pkg` | Print compiled package groups and build units. |
| `board` | `board` | Print board ID, name, and capabilities. |
| `engine` | `engine [status|reset]` | Print or reset generic engine utilization counters for CPU/SIMD-style backends and vector bulk operations. |
| `display` | `display [list]`; `display test <target>`; `display mode <target> [mode]` | List drawable display targets, draw a test pattern, or change driver-specific display settings. |
| `status` | `status` | Print a compact system status summary. |
| `uptime` | `uptime` | Print elapsed time since boot. |
| `mem` | `mem [policy]` | Print heap status; `policy` also shows allocation-class counters, guarded fallback limits, and the last tagged failure. |
| `top` | `top` | Print FreeRTOS task resource information when available. |
| `sleep` | `sleep` | Enter explicit light sleep. |
| `power` | See below | Inspect and configure power policy. |
| `setterm` | See below | Configure terminal/input preferences. Without arguments, opens the display TUI when available. |

`power` usage:

```text
power status
power profile [performance|balanced|solar|offline]
power idle [off|seconds]
power key [off|light]
power sleep
```

Profiles:

| Profile | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `performance` | Maximum configured CPU frequency, no automatic light sleep. |
| `balanced` | CPU frequency scaling down to 80 MHz, no automatic light sleep. This is the default. |
| `solar` | CPU capped at 80 MHz with ESP-IDF automatic light sleep. |
| `offline` | CPU capped at 80 MHz, automatic light sleep, and display-shell idle sleep after 60 seconds. |

`setterm` usage:

```text
setterm
setterm orientation [0|90|180|270]
setterm font [mono|compact]
setterm textsize [12|14|16|18|20]
setterm brightness [0..100]
setterm backlight [0..100]
setterm profile [vt100|ansi|dumb]
setterm keyboard [us|de]
setterm keyrate [off|1..60 [delay-ms]]
setterm timezone [UTC|Europe/Berlin|POSIX-TZ]
setterm otaurl [url]
```

`setterm profile` is runtime-only and applies to the current port shell. From
the display shell it prints guidance to set the profile from a port shell.
Display layout settings (`orientation`, `font`, and `textsize`) apply to the
current display and its app sessions. Settings on the primary display are
persistent; settings on secondary or virtual displays such as `web0` are
runtime-only.

## Apps And Jobs

| Command | Usage | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apps` | `apps` | List registered foreground apps compiled into the firmware. |
| `jobs` | `jobs` | List registered jobs and their state. |
| `job` | `job status [name]` | Show one job or all jobs. |
| `job` | `job start <name> [args...]` | Start or restart a job. |
| `job` | `job stop <name>` | Stop a job. |
| `session` | `session list` | List display app sessions, display shell sessions, and port shell sessions. |
| `session` | `session create shell <port> [--term auto|vt100|ansi|dumb] [--size COLSxROWS]` | Start a shell session on a byte-stream port. |
| `session` | `session create shell <display-target>` | Attach a shell session to a ready display target such as `lcd0`. |
| `session` | `session fg <id>` or `session switch <id>` | Resume a display app or display shell session. |
| `session` | `session close <id>` | Close a display app or display shell session, or stop a port shell session. |
| `session` | `session background` | Print the current foreground/background-session note. |

Port shells default to `--term auto`. Auto mode sends a terminal Device
Attributes probe; a recognizable response enables VT100-style cursor controls
and a size probe, while no response falls back to a dumb line-oriented shell.
Use `--term vt100` or `--term ansi` to force escape-sequence output,
`--term dumb` for plain text, and `--size COLSxROWS` to set the terminal dimensions
without probing.

`jobs` prints a compact table that fits the built-in display terminal:

```text
NAME         STATE    KIND        EVT  TICKS RES
batmon       running  background  tick    17   1
log          stopped  background  tick     0   0
```

Columns:

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `NAME` | Job registry name. |
| `STATE` | `stopped`, `running`, or `failed`. |
| `KIND` | Job kind. Current registry jobs are background workers. |
| `EVT` | `tick` if the job receives periodic tick events, otherwise `-`. |
| `TICKS` | Number of dispatched tick events while running. |
| `RES` | Number of resources currently recorded for the job. |

Use `job status <name>` for the job summary, owner string, last error, effective
tick interval/deadline, last and maximum handler time, deadline-miss count, and
resource details. `sessions` prints the same timing telemetry for display and
port sessions as one row per session in `ID TITLE APP STATE TIME` order. In the
`TIME` column, the first pair is `interval/deadline` in milliseconds, the second
is `last/max` in microseconds, `n` is the dispatch count, and `!` is the deadline
miss count. Job timing detail uses the same values with explicit labels.
Job-owned resources use owner strings such as `job:log`; port
conflicts are reported as readable messages such as `job log owns cdc0`.

Common job examples:

```text
session create shell cdc0
session create shell uart0 --term vt100 --size 100x30
session create shell lcd0
job start log cdc0
job start log file /.shell/log info
job start bridge cdc0 uart0
job start httpd /www
job start displayd [display-target]   # display0 by default, web0 when headless
job start ntp-sync once
job start batmon 60
job start slip uart0 115200
job stop log
```

Only one instance of each built-in job name is active at a time. Starting the
same job again stops the previous instance and starts it with the new arguments.

`daq` CSV rows include `uptime_ms`, and include UTC `time_ms` when wall-clock time is
trusted. Raw mode is byte-stream only, single-stream only, and writes bytes
directly without CSV framing.

Board-specific connector resources, runtime GPIO policy, named buses, leases,
and attachment examples are documented in [Expansion Ports](expansion.md).
Use `expansion status` and `gpio list` for the authoritative view on a running
device.

The `onewire` command accepts a registered bus name or any runtime-accessible
GPIO. `onewire status` discovers named buses, while the numeric form preserves
the direct-pin workflow. Every `xfer` starts with a 1-Wire reset, writes the
supplied bytes, and then reads `read-len` bytes. For example,
`onewire xfer 1 9 0xcc 0xbe` issues Skip ROM and Read Scratchpad, then reads a
nine-byte scratchpad. The equivalent named form starts with
`onewire xfer onewire0`. ROM address bytes supplied to `xfer` use
least-significant-byte-first wire order. The service enables the ESP32 internal
pull-up, but a 4.7 kohm external pull-up from the data line to 3.3 V is strongly
recommended. The internal pull-up is not a parasite-power supply.

Physical displays are listed by `display list`. A built-in board panel registers
as a board display target such as `display0`; an expansion display driver stays
in `expansion drivers` as attachable hardware and registers a display target
after it is attached. The built-in board panel is not an expansion driver.
`display list` includes the current owner when a target is claimed. `display
test <target>` claims the target while it draws a visible frame/test pattern,
then releases it. `display mode <target>` lists driver-specific display
settings for supported display drivers; `display mode <target> <mode>` applies
one setting. With `power=auto`, the built-in ST7305 path uses the normal power
profile before writing changed frame content and switches to the paired `lpm`
profile after the frame has been idle for the configured driver debounce, or
immediately when a present pass finds no changed pixels. The default ST7305
idle debounce is 1000 ms. The advanced
`display mode <target> idle-lpm-ms=<ms>` driver option updates it at runtime
and persists it in the ST7305 NVS namespace. ST7305 tuning options also live on
this driver-specific mode surface: `power=<auto|hpm|lpm>` selects automatic
idle switching or a forced power mode, `inverted=<on|off>` selects panel
inversion, `lpm-hz=<0.25|0.5|1|2|4|8>` changes the controller's LPM frame-rate
field, and `hpm-hz=<16|25.5|32|51>` changes the controller's HPM frame-rate
field. These driver values are stored in NVS when changed.
On the CrowPanel SSD1683 path, `refresh=auto` uses a full waveform for the first
changed frame and after every 19 fast updates, while unchanged frames are
skipped. `refresh=fast` forces the faster waveform and `refresh=full` forces the
full waveform on every changed frame.

Packet radio devices are datagram endpoints registered by expansion drivers, not
byte-stream ports. The common radio layer preserves packet metadata such as RSSI
and optional source/destination IDs. Radio frequency values are Hz by default
and also accept `k`, `kHz`, `M`, and `MHz` suffixes:

```text
radio status radio0
radio config radio0 frequency 433MHz
radio config radio0 modulation gfsk
radio send radio0 hello
radio recv radio0 5000
```

The POCSAG job configures an attached packet radio for one paging channel,
filters addresses to one RIC, corrects up to two bad bits per BCH codeword, and
publishes decoded pages to the universal inbox. Consecutive POCSAG batches are
kept in one message. For the 448.425 MHz test channel:

```text
job start pocsag radio 448425000 1200 1841525 alpha
pocsag status
inbox list unread
```

Use `inverted` as the final argument if the transmitter and receiver use
opposite FSK mark/space polarity. Stopping the job restores the radio's previous
configuration and state.

To transmit a page, stop the receiver when it uses the same half-duplex radio,
then send the message. Alphanumeric pages default to function 3; numeric pages
default to function 0. The optional final argument selects function 0 through 3.
The previous radio configuration and state are restored after transmission.

```text
job stop pocsag
pocsag send radio 448425000 1200 1841525 "SolarOS calling" alpha inverted
```
