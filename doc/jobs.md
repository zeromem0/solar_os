# SolarOS Jobs

This document covers the built-in background job registry. Jobs are autonomous
workers such as log followers, DAQ capture, HTTP serving, Telnet shell access,
SLIP, chatd, or NTP sync. Foreground applications are documented in
[apps.md](apps.md), and shell commands are documented in
[commands.md](commands.md). Port shells are sessions, started with
`session create shell <port>` plus optional `--term` and `--size` terminal
settings. Display-target shells use `session create shell <target>`.

Job availability depends on the selected firmware flavor and board
capabilities. The running system is authoritative:

```text
jobs
job status [name]
```

`jobs` is intentionally compact so it fits on the built-in 65-column display
terminal. It shows job name, state, kind, event source, tick count, and resource
count. Use `job status <name>` for the summary, owner string, last error,
effective tick interval/deadline, runtime duration statistics, deadline misses,
and claimed resources. Compact timing lines use `interval/deadline` in
milliseconds, `n` for dispatches, `us=last/max`, and `miss` for deadline misses.

## Job Control

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `jobs` | List registered jobs in compact form. |
| `job status [name]` | Show all jobs, or one named job with details. |
| `job start <name> [args...]` | Start a job with optional arguments. |
| `job stop <name>` | Stop a running job. |

Only one instance of each job name can run at a time. Starting a running job
first stops the previous instance, then starts it again with the new arguments.

Jobs have stable owner strings in the form `job:<name>`. Jobs that claim ports,
files, streams, or network listeners publish those resources through the job
status model. This keeps port/resource conflict messages readable and avoids
job-specific inspection code in the shell.

Jobs that use byte-stream ports claim those ports while running. If a port is
already owned, SolarOS reports the owner, for example `job log owns cdc0`.
Radio listeners expose their radio as a custom job resource.

Tick intervals and execution-time deadlines are declared by each event-driven
job. A zero descriptor value selects the runtime default. Deadline misses do
not forcibly terminate a cooperative handler; SolarOS counts them, records the
last and maximum duration, and emits rate-limited warnings. The DAQ and log
handlers only enqueue work, so their stream, filesystem, and port I/O runs in
isolated worker tasks instead of the display scheduler.

Compact list example:

```text
NAME         STATE    KIND        EVT  TICKS RES
batmon       running  background  tick    17   1
log          stopped  background  tick     0   0
```

Detailed status example:

```text
job status log
NAME         STATE    KIND        EVT  TICKS RES
log          running  background  tick     8   1
  summary: stream SolarOS logs to a port or file
  owner: job:log
  tick: 250/2ms n=8 us=18/31 miss=0
  resources:
  - port   cdc0 rw
```

Useful ports:

```text
cdc0
uart0
```

List available streams with:

```text
stream
```

## Startup

Jobs can be started from the normal startup script:

```text
/.shell/startup
```

Example:

```text
wifi on
job start ntp-sync once
job start batmon 60
```

## batmon

Battery monitor. It periodically samples battery voltage, maintains a smoothed
trend, estimates power state, and can request light sleep when the configured
minimum voltage is reached.

Usage:

```text
job start batmon [interval-sec]
job stop batmon
job status batmon
```

Defaults:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Interval | `60` seconds |

Battery limits are configured with the `battery` shell command:

```text
battery capacity <mAh>
battery min_voltage <volts>
battery max_voltage <volts>
```

Notes:

- Discharging trend means battery power.
- Charging trend means external power.
- Voltage above `max_voltage` is a fast external-power shortcut.
- Three consecutive samples at or below `min_voltage` while on battery request
  light sleep.

Example:

```text
job start batmon 60
```

## bridge

Raw bidirectional byte bridge between two byte-stream ports.

Usage:

```text
job start bridge <port-a> <port-b>
job stop bridge
job status bridge
```

Example:

```text
job start bridge cdc0 uart0
```

Notes:

- The two ports must be different.
- Both ports are claimed by the bridge job until it stops.
- This is the clean base for USB-to-UART converter style workflows.

## chat-sync

Background client synchronizer for the transport-neutral chat service. Start and
stop it explicitly, using the same lifecycle as `email-sync`:

```text
job start chat-sync
job stop chat-sync
job status chat-sync
```

`chat-sync` takes no polling interval. Unlike the periodic `email-sync` job, it
maintains a live connection and applies its own exponential reconnect backoff.
It can therefore be started before Wi-Fi has an address; it remains running and
connects when the network becomes available. In `/.shell/startup`, use exactly:

```text
job start chat-sync
```

It owns transport connection lifetime, exponential retry, opaque resume cursors,
joined-channel replay, outbound queue delivery, retained message publication,
and chat notifications in the universal inbox. Replayed transport messages are
deduplicated by the shared stable producer identity before another notification
is published.
Stopping or closing `app.chat` has no effect on this job. Its worker performs
transport startup, polling, and retry work outside the cooperative session/job
scheduler.

The store retains at most 64 messages. SD-backed systems use the full-message
`/.chat/messages.bin` ring. Systems using internal flash restore Chat history
from the compact records already stored in `/.inbox/messages.bin`; no second
ring is created, so Chat history cannot consume the remaining flash volume.

## chatd

Local SolarOS chat gateway server. It is useful for testing the `chat` app or
for small trusted local networks.

Usage:

```text
job start chatd [port] [token] [--history path]
job start chatd [port] [token] [path]
job stop chatd
job status chatd
```

Defaults:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Port | `7777` |
| Default channel | `general` |
| Maximum clients | `6` |
| Maximum channels | `32` |
| In-memory history | `64` events |

Arguments are intentionally flexible. The first numeric argument is the port.
The next non-option argument is the optional token. `--history` or `--log`
selects an optional append-only history dump file.

Examples:

```text
job start chatd
job start chatd 7777 secret
job start chatd 7777 secret --history /.shell/chatd.log
```

The local chat app can connect with:

```text
chat local
chat 127.0.0.1:7777
```

On another SolarOS device or host on the same network, use the server IP:

```text
chat 192.168.1.113:7777
```

Notes:

- If a token is configured, clients must present the same token.
- New clients receive the recent in-memory channel history.
- Channel deletion is supported by the chat protocol and client.
- The built-in server is a lightweight LAN gateway, not a hardened public chat
  service.

## daq

Data acquisition job. It captures scalar streams to timestamped CSV, or one
byte stream directly to a raw file.

The `daq` shell command is usually easier to remember:

```text
daq
daq streams
daq start <stream...> <file> [options]
daq start <file> <stream...> [options]
daq stop
daq status
```

Direct job usage:

```text
job start daq <stream...> <file> [--rate seconds|--rate-ms ms] [--append|--replace]
job start daq <file> <stream...> [--rate seconds|--rate-ms ms] [--append|--replace]
job start daq <byte-stream> <file> --raw [--rate-ms ms] [--append|--replace]
job stop daq
job status daq
```

Defaults:

| Mode | Default interval |
| --- | --- |
| Scalar CSV | `1000` ms |
| Raw byte stream | `25` ms |

Examples:

```text
daq start temperature /logs/temp.csv --rate 60
daq start /logs/env.csv temperature humidity battery --rate 60
daq start uart0 /logs/uart0.bin --raw --rate-ms 25
job start daq /logs/env.csv temperature humidity battery --rate 60
```

Notes:

- Multi-stream mode supports scalar streams only.
- Raw capture is single-stream only and writes incoming bytes directly.
- CSV rows include a timestamp column and one value column per stream.
- Available streams depend on board capabilities.

## displayd

Authenticated HTTP display and remote control. It has two modes:

- With a physical target such as `display0`, it mirrors and controls the
  foreground session using that display without allocating another display
  framebuffer.
- With `web0`, it creates an independent 400x300 monochrome virtual display
  and a detached display shell. Apps launched from that shell stay on `web0`
  and do not replace the foreground app on a physical display.

With no target argument, `displayd` mirrors `display0` when it exists and
otherwise creates `web0`. The latter makes the same command useful on headless
PSRAM-equipped boards.

Usage:

```text
job start displayd [target]
job stop displayd
job status displayd
```

Example:

```text
wifi on
job start displayd
job start displayd web0
```

Starting the job prints a random six-digit access code. Open
`http://<device>/display`, enter that code, and click the displayed image
before typing. The browser frontend polls the native 1-bit U8g2 frame up to
twenty times per second and performs pixel rotation in the browser instead of
the HTTP server task. It sends bounded key input through the scheduler.
`Ctrl+]` remains the application-exit key.

API:

```text
GET  /api/displays
GET  /api/displays/<target>/frame.pbm
GET  /api/displays/<target>/frame.raw
POST /api/displays/<target>/input
```

All API requests require `Authorization: Bearer <code>`. The access code is
never accepted in the URL. The built-in frontend itself is public so that it
can prompt for the code, but keeps the supplied code only in page memory.

Notes:

- `web0` is registered as `source=virtual`, `driver=framebuffer` while the job
  is running. Its framebuffer and session exist independently of whether a
  browser is connected.
- `displayd` creates and owns the `web0` shell session itself and prints its
  session ID. Do not run `session create shell web0` afterward; the target is
  already attached to the browser-controlled shell.
- `Ctrl+]` exits a foreground app on `web0` and returns to its detached shell.
  The physical foreground session is unaffected.
- The physical mirror reuses the active U8g2 display and does not create
  another display session.
- A consistent 1-bit frame snapshot and same-sized raw transmit buffer are held
  in PSRAM while the job runs. For the Waveshare display they consume 30,400
  bytes in total. `web0` additionally owns its 15,200-byte U8g2 framebuffer,
  for 45,600 bytes of fixed frame storage in total. HTTP transmission never
  holds a display or registry lock.
- The snapshot is copied into the transmit buffer and released before network
  I/O, so a slow browser cannot prevent newer display frames from being
  published.
- The browser uses `frame.raw` to avoid per-pixel PBM conversion on the ESP32.
  The PBM endpoint remains available for simple external clients.
- If a browser is still reading a frame when the display presents again, that
  publication is skipped rather than blocking the display.
- Input is queued by the HTTP task and dispatched only by the normal SolarOS
  scheduler. Physical targets accept it only while they are foreground;
  `web0` receives it through its target-addressed detached session.
- The server is plain HTTP. The six-digit code provides convenient access
  control on a trusted Wi-Fi network but does not encrypt frames or input and
  is not intended for exposure to an untrusted network.
- `displayd` and `httpd` share one HTTP server and may run simultaneously.

## httpd

Static HTTP file server for a folder on mounted storage.

Usage:

```text
job start httpd <folder>
job stop httpd
job status httpd
```

Example:

```text
job start httpd /www
```

Notes:

- Relative paths resolve under the default storage mount.
- The server uses the ESP-IDF default HTTP port.
- It shares the service-owned HTTP server with `displayd`.
- It serves files and simple directory listings.
- MIME types are provided for common text, image, audio, JSON, JavaScript, and
  CSS files.

## irrigd

Irrigation schedule engine. It evaluates zone schedules against the local
clock once per second and drives the configured relay GPIOs. Configuration
(zones, schedules, mode, pins) lives in NVS and is edited with the `irrig`
shell command or the `irriga` graphical app; the job is only the evaluator,
so watering continues no matter which app is in the foreground.

Usage:

```text
job start irrigd [http-port|off]
job stop irrigd
job status irrigd
```

Defaults:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Web editor port | `8081` (own server; unused when attached to `remote`) |

On builds with Wi-Fi, the job also serves a browser schedule editor:
one tab per zone, a card per schedule slot with start/end time fields,
weekday toggles, an active switch, a live screenshot of the device
display, and a single SAVE that applies everything within one engine
tick. `job start irrigd off` disables it.

If the `remote` job's server is already running, the editor registers
on it at `/irrig` instead of starting a second HTTP server (two
instances contend for sockets and starve each other's transfers on
weak links) and `http-port` is ignored. Otherwise the editor gets its
own server on `http-port`. The attach happens at start time: after
(re)starting `remote`, restart `irrigd` to re-attach.

Notes:

- Relay outputs are treated as active-low (on = pin low).
- Zones without an assigned pin are evaluated as pure state, so schedules can
  be tested with no hardware wired.
- If the clock has no integrity (RTC not set, no NTP sync), schedules are
  forced off rather than watering at a wrong time.
- Stopping the job turns all zones off.

## log

Runtime SolarOS log follower. It mirrors log entries to a byte-stream port or
appends them to a file.

Usage:

```text
job start log <port> [error|warn|info|debug]
job start log file <path> [error|warn|info|debug]
job stop log
job status log
```

Examples:

```text
job start log cdc0
job start log uart0 debug
job start log file /.shell/log info
```

Notes:

- Port targets use CRLF line endings.
- File targets use LF line endings and are flushed periodically.
- If no level is specified, the current runtime log level is used.
- The log job starts from the latest entry, so it follows new logs rather than
  dumping the whole ring.

## telnetd

Remote Telnet shell server. The listener is a background job; each accepted
connection is attached to its own normal SolarOS port-shell session.

Usage:

```text
job start telnetd [port] [--password password]
job stop telnetd
job status telnetd
```

Examples:

```text
job start telnetd
job start telnetd 2323 --password local-secret
```

Notes:

- The default port is `23`.
- One remote client is supported at a time. Additional clients receive a busy
  response and are disconnected.
- Telnet terminal-type and window-size negotiation select the terminal profile
  and update the shell dimensions.
- Disconnecting closes the child shell session and releases any foreground app
  or resource it owns.
- Remote sessions do not run `/.shell/startup`.
- Telnet is unencrypted. The optional password limits access but is also sent
  over the network in plaintext, and the start command remains in the local
  shell history. Use this service only on a trusted network.

## ntp-sync

Network time synchronization job. It updates the SolarOS wall clock from NTP
and also updates the hardware RTC when the board provides one.

Usage:

```text
job start ntp-sync [once] [interval-sec] [server]
job stop ntp-sync
job status ntp-sync
```

Defaults:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Interval | `60` seconds |
| Server | `pool.ntp.org` |

Examples:

```text
job start ntp-sync once
job start ntp-sync 300 time.cloudflare.com
job start ntp-sync once 60 pool.ntp.org
```

Notes:

- Wi-Fi must be connected before sync can succeed.
- In `once` mode, the job retries at the interval until the first successful
  sync, then stops itself.
- Without `once`, it keeps syncing periodically.

## email-sync

Receive-only IMAPS mailbox polling job. It fetches mail into the provider-local
`email` app and publishes each new message to the universal inbox.

Usage:

```text
job start email-sync [interval-sec] [once]
job stop email-sync
job status email-sync
```

The default interval is 300 seconds; accepted values are 30 through 86400
seconds. `once` stops the job after one attempt. The account must be configured
first:

```text
wifi on
email configure imaps://imap.example.com user@example.com app-password INBOX
job start email-sync 300
```

To start polling after each reboot, add the following after `wifi on` in
`/.shell/startup`:

```text
job start email-sync 300
```

Notes:

- TLS certificate validation is mandatory; plaintext IMAP is not accepted.
- The first synchronization imports up to the newest eight messages. Later
  polls process new UIDs in batches of eight, so a busy mailbox catches up over
  successive intervals without overflowing the response buffer.
- The provider-local list keeps 32 messages in volatile memory. Universal inbox
  notifications use the mailbox as topic, the `From` header as sender, and the
  subject as title.
- Body previews are best effort. Full MIME decoding, attachments, SMTP sending,
  and server-side read-state synchronization remain future work.

## remote

Web screen share and keyboard. It serves the live display as a 1bpp BMP plus
a self-contained page that refreshes it and forwards browser keystrokes into
the input dispatch, so the device can be driven from any browser on the LAN.

Usage:

```text
job start remote [port]
job stop remote
job status remote
```

Defaults:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Port | `8080` |

Routes:

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Screen view (auto-refreshing) plus keyboard capture and a button row |
| `/keys` | Keyboard only, no screen image -- for slow or unreliable links |
| `/screen.bmp` | Current display as a 1bpp BMP |
| `/key?c=<code>` | Inject one key (SolarOS key codes for specials, ASCII otherwise) |

`/screen.bmp` takes optional query parameters for links that cannot move a
whole frame in one response: `d=2|4` decimates (every d-th pixel of every
d-th row), `s=<i>&n=<k>` returns horizontal strip `i` of `k` (0-based,
`k <= 8`) at full resolution. The main page fetches the screen as four
strips in sequence and stacks them.

Notes:

- No authentication -- LAN use only, same trust model as the httpd job.
- On builds with the irrigation web editor, `irrigd` attaches the schedule
  editor to this server at `/irrig` (see irrigd above).

## pocsag

POCSAG pager receiver job. It configures a registered packet radio for a
continuous POCSAG byte stream, frames successive 64-byte batches, filters pages
to one receiver identity code (RIC), decodes alphanumeric or numeric payloads,
and publishes completed messages to the universal inbox.

Usage:

```text
job start pocsag <radio> <frequency-hz> <baud> <ric> [alpha|numeric] [normal|inverted]
job stop pocsag
job status pocsag
pocsag status
pocsag send <radio> <frequency-hz> <baud> <ric> <message> [alpha|numeric] [normal|inverted] [function]
```

Example:

```text
job start pocsag radio 448425000 1200 1841525 alpha
inbox list unread

job stop pocsag
pocsag send radio 448425000 1200 1841525 "SolarOS calling" alpha inverted
```

Notes:

- The decoder validates POCSAG parity and BCH and corrects up to two erroneous
  bits per codeword.
- Messages may continue across batch boundaries; the receiver follows the sync
  words between batches until the page is complete.
- Identical repeated pages received within 30 seconds produce one inbox entry.
- The default FSK polarity is `normal`; retry with `inverted` if batches remain
  at zero while the transmitter is active.
- `pocsag status` shows batch/message counts, corrections, receive errors, and
  the RSSI of the most recent batch.
- Stopping the job restores the radio configuration and state that were active
  when it started.
- Sending supports messages spanning multiple batches and restores the radio's
  previous configuration afterward. A receiver job using the same half-duplex
  radio must be stopped first.

## slip

IPv4 SLIP gateway on a byte-stream port. This is intended for retro machines,
headless boards, and serial networking experiments.

Usage:

```text
job start slip [port] [baud] [local-ip] [peer-ip] [netmask]
job stop slip
job status slip
```

Defaults:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Port | `uart0` |
| Baud | `115200` |
| Local IP | `192.168.7.1` |
| Peer IP | `192.168.7.2` |
| Netmask | `255.255.255.252` |

Examples:

```text
job start slip uart0 115200
job start slip cdc0 115200
job start slip uart0 38400 192.168.7.1 192.168.7.2 255.255.255.252
```

Notes:

- The peer should use the local IP as its gateway.
- SolarOS enables NAT on the SLIP-facing interface.
- The selected port is claimed by the SLIP job until it stops.
- `cdc0` is useful for Linux host testing; `uart0` is the natural expansion
  port path.

## sump

SUMP-compatible logic analyzer server on `cdc0`. It claims the CDC port and
uses the shared logic analyzer service for acquisition. PulseView and sigrok
can connect with the OpenBench Logic Sniffer/SUMP serial driver.

Usage:

```text
job start sump [pin ...]
job start sump [pin[,pin...]]
job stop sump
job status sump
```

Examples:

```text
job start sump
job start sump 1 2 3 17
job start sump 1,2,3,17
```

If no pins are supplied, the job uses up to eight runtime-safe GPIOs from the
active board profile. Host commands select the sample rate and capture size.
The current implementation supports 10 kHz to 2 MHz requests and up to 32768
one-byte samples; the status recorded with each capture reports the measured
effective rate.

Notes:

- The job requires both CDC and runtime-safe GPIO capabilities.
- `cdc0` cannot be used by a port shell, logger, bridge, or another job while
  SUMP is active. Start SUMP from the display shell, SSH, or another port after
  stopping any shell attached to `cdc0`.
- Basic trigger commands are accepted for host compatibility, but this first
  implementation captures immediately instead of waiting for a trigger.
- Captures remain available to the `logic` app after the job stops.
