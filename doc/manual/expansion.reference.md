# Expansion Ports

SolarOS treats an expansion port as a board-described collection of resources,
not as one fixed connector standard. A board may expose individual GPIO pins,
named I2C, SPI, UART, or MIDI buses, or free pins that can be routed to an approved
spare peripheral host at runtime.

Use `expansion layout` for the physical connector arrangement, and use
`expansion status` and `gpio list` on the running device for the authoritative
resource view. The layout overlays live pin policy and claims; the available
resources depend on the board and the compiled firmware flavor. Boards with
multiple named headers can be filtered, for example with `expansion layout J1`.

## Resource Model

| Term | Meaning | Ownership and lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connector pin | A signal physically present on an expansion header or breakout. Physical presence does not make a pin safe for runtime control. | Described by the board profile. |
| Runtime GPIO | A connector pin approved for direct `gpio` and 1-Wire use, and for `adc` or `pwm` where the board tables allow it. | Claimed while a service or attached device uses it. |
| Board-defined bus | A named bus with fixed pins, such as `i2c0` or `spi0`. | Registered at boot and cannot be removed. A named UART can still be detached and reattached. |
| Runtime bus | A named bus routed onto approved free pins and a spare hardware host. | It can be removed when idle. UART controller and pin claims follow attach/detach; other bus signals remain claimed for the descriptor lifetime. |
| Expansion driver | Code that knows how to initialize and operate a supported external device. | Listed by `expansion drivers`; availability is package- and capability-filtered. |
| Attached device | A named driver instance bound to buses, addresses, chip-selects, or GPIO roles. | Acquires resource leases on attach and releases them on detach. |

Board pin policy has three levels:

| Policy | Direct GPIO | Runtime bus routing | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Free | Yes | Yes | Uncommitted expansion pin. |
| Releasable | No | Yes, after its current service releases it. | UART or another default board role. |
| Fixed | No | No | Boot straps, flash/PSRAM, display, storage, USB, controls, or other board hardware. |

This policy is separate from physical connector membership. For example, a
strapping pin may appear on a header and in the physical connector description
while remaining blocked from runtime use.

I2C and SPI buses accept shared logical leases. UART, MIDI, and registered 1-Wire bus
instances are exclusive. Registered 1-Wire buses appear in expansion status
and can be addressed by name. Bus names are unique across protocols.

I2C, SPI, UART, MIDI, and 1-Wire buses can be created at runtime. Runtime hardware
buses require an unused board-approved controller or host; all signal pins must
be approved by the board's runtime pin policy. Every named UART has an explicit
attached state. Attaching reserves its controller and pins; the hardware driver
still starts lazily on the first consumer claim and stops after the final claim.
Detaching an idle UART releases the controller and pins but preserves its name
and configuration. Runtime UART descriptors may additionally be removed;
board-defined UART descriptors cannot.
The direct numeric form of the `onewire` command remains available without
creating a named expansion bus.

## Typical Workflow

Start by inspecting the live resource map and compiled drivers:

```text
expansion layout
expansion status
gpio list
expansion drivers
expansion scan
```

If the device can use a board-defined bus, attach it directly. The device name
is chosen by the user and becomes the lease owner:

```text
expansion attach ssd1306 oled0 i2c=i2c0 addr=0x3c
expansion devices
display test oled0
expansion detach oled0
```

Runtime I2C and 1-Wire buses use the same lifecycle:

```text
expansion bus create i2c i2c1 port=i2c1 sda=gpio14 scl=gpio15 speed=100000
i2c scan i2c1
expansion bus remove i2c1

expansion bus create onewire onewire0 pin=gpio16
onewire scan onewire0
expansion bus remove onewire0

expansion bus create ps2 ps2kbd clock=gpio17 data=gpio18
expansion attach ps2-keyboard keyboard0 ps2=ps2kbd
input test keyboard0
expansion detach keyboard0
expansion bus remove ps2kbd

expansion bus create uart uart1 port=uart1 tx=gpio14 rx=gpio15 baud=115200
uart status uart1
uart write uart1 AT
expansion bus detach uart1
expansion bus attach uart1
expansion bus remove uart1

expansion bus create midi midi0 tx=gpio1 rx=gpio2
job start midi midi0
midi status
midi monitor
midi note-on 1 60 100
midi note-off 1 60
midi stream add 1 74
control create cutoff midi.cc.1.74 0 127
control bind cutoff parameter synth.filter.cutoff pickup=off
job start controls
job stop midi
expansion bus remove midi0
```

MIDI is a user-facing bus type with an automatically selected UART backend.
Its optional `baud=` defaults to 31250; there is no `port=` argument. The
resolved `uartN` appears in status output only to help diagnose controller
allocation. A standard DIN connection requires an optoisolated MIDI IN circuit
and a current-limited MIDI OUT driver. Never connect DIN MIDI pins directly to
ESP32 GPIOs.

An explicitly configured `midi.cc.<channel>.<controller>` scalar stream retains
the latest matching incoming CC value while the MIDI job runs. The controls job
can normalize its `0..127` range and bind it to one or more application
parameters without consuming messages from MIDI subscribers.

On the Waveshare board, `uart0` owns the releasable GPIO43/GPIO44 pair while it
is attached. From a display or other non-`uart0` shell, detach it before reusing
those pins and attach it again after the temporary bus is removed:

```text
expansion bus detach uart0
expansion bus create uart uart1 port=uart1 tx=gpio43 rx=gpio44
expansion bus remove uart1
expansion bus attach uart0
```

Detaching the port that carries the current shell fails as busy, so the shell
cannot disconnect itself accidentally.

On a board with an approved available SPI host, create a bus before attaching the
device. Creating the bus claims its controller, SCLK, MOSI, and optional MISO
immediately. Each `cs=` option declares an allowed chip-select pin but leaves it
available until a device or one-shot transfer selects it. That user claims both
the GPIO and logical chip-select slot, preventing GPIO or SPI users from driving
it concurrently:

```text
expansion bus create spi spi1 host=spi3 sclk=gpio1 mosi=gpio2 miso=gpio3 cs=gpio17
expansion attach rfm69 radio0 spi=spi1 cs=gpio17
expansion detach radio0
expansion bus remove spi1
```

On the Elecrow CrowPanel, run `disk umount` before creating the runtime SPI3 bus.
Remove that bus before using `disk mount` to make SPI3 available to microSD again.

The `spi` command addresses board-defined and runtime buses by name. This makes
the same transfer tools available for `spi0`, `spi1`, or any other registered
SPI bus:

```text
spi status
spi status spi1
spi xfer spi1 gpio17 0 1m 0x9f 0 0 0
spi read spi1 gpio17 0 1m 4 0xff
spi write spi1 gpio17 0 1m 0xaa 0x55
```

The bus name and chip-select are always explicit. Transfers temporarily claim
the selected chip-select and lease the bus, so they fail cleanly when an
attached device already owns that chip-select.

The `i2c` command also accepts a named bus. Omitting it retains the `i2c0`
shortcut used by existing scripts:

```text
i2c status i2c0
i2c scan i2c0
i2c probe i2c0 0x3c
i2c read i2c0 0x50 0x00 8
i2c write i2c0 0x50 0x00 0xaa 0x55
```

Omit `miso` or use `miso=none` for output-only peripherals. A runtime bus can
only use a host and pins approved by the board profile. It cannot take fixed
display, storage, I2C, USB, or strapping pins. A bus cannot be detached or
removed while it has device leases, and board-defined buses can never be
removed. `expansion bus detach` preserves the named descriptor and works for
every runtime bus plus board buses whose owned pins are marked releasable.
Fixed-pin board buses reject detach.

## Drivers and Bindings

Run `expansion drivers` on the device to see the exact compiled set.

Manual profiles are useful when another app or workflow operates the hardware
but SolarOS still needs to prevent conflicting claims:

```text
expansion attach manual radio0 spi0 cs=gpio10 irq=gpio4 reset=gpio5
expansion attach manual sensor0 i2c0 addr=0x40
expansion detach radio0
```

Binding names may be explicit (`spi=spi0`, `i2c=i2c0`) or, where unambiguous,
supplied as positional bus names. `ce=` aliases `cs=` and `rst=` aliases
`reset=` for common module labels.

The name `display0` is reserved for the board's primary display attachment.
Use another name such as `lcd0` for a runtime-attached display. The six
integrated-display drivers attach before display-service initialization when a
board profile declares them as fixed defaults. When a controller driver is not
already attached, a later attachment registers an auxiliary target for
`display test`, graphical sessions, and applications. Each controller driver
supports one attached instance. A fixed board default cannot be detached.

Select the RFM69 driver from the module variant, not from the requested power.
The `rfm69h` driver uses PA1 through 13 dBm, PA1+PA2 through 17 dBm, and applies
the datasheet high-power OCP/TestPA settings only during 18-20 dBm transmit.
Those settings are restored before standby, receive, or sleep. Both module
families require 3.3 V power and a band-appropriate antenna.

### WS2812/NeoPixel strip

Use a runtime-safe expansion GPIO for DIN. The driver uses an ESP32 RMT transmit
channel and supports up to 256 GRB pixels per attached strip:

```text
5V supply + -> strip 5V       supply GND -> strip GND and SolarOS board GND
GPIO1 -> level shifter -> strip DIN

expansion attach neopixel pixels0 data=gpio1 count=8
neopixel set pixels0 0 32 0 0
neopixel fill pixels0 0 0 16
neopixel clear pixels0
expansion detach pixels0
```

Use an external supply sized for the strip; full-white WS2812 pixels can draw
roughly 60 mA each. Do not power a multi-pixel strip from a board GPIO. A 3.3 V
data signal may work with short wiring when the strip supply is low enough, but
a 3.3-to-5 V logic-level shifter is the reliable arrangement. Put the usual
bulk capacitor across the strip supply and a small series resistor near DIN.

### LEDC PWM audio output

Use a runtime-safe PWM pin. The driver updates an 8-bit, 78.125 kHz LEDC carrier
from a GPTimer-paced 16 kHz mono PCM stream. It registers the attached name as
an audio device and `<name>.playback` as its stream:

```text
expansion attach audio-pwm pwm0 pwm=gpio1
audio device pwm0
audio default pwm0
aplay /audio/example.mp3
```

`audio default` is runtime-only because attached expansion devices are also
runtime-only. Run `audio default auto` to return to the first compatible output.
Detaching the selected device also returns selection to `auto`.

Do not connect a speaker directly to the GPIO. The pin provides a 3.3 V PWM
signal centered near 50 percent duty during silence. Use a reconstruction
low-pass filter, a DC-blocking/coupling stage, and an amplifier suitable for the
speaker impedance. Keep the board and amplifier grounds common. Stop playback
before detaching; detach reports busy while the playback stream is open.

### PCM5102A I2S audio output

Wire the module's BCK, DIN, and RCK pins to three runtime-safe output GPIOs and
connect SCK to ground. The driver is an I2S master in Philips format with
32-bit slots, so its 16-bit stereo stream supplies the 64 BCK cycles per frame
needed by the PCM5102A PLL at 16 kHz. The attached name becomes an audio device
and `<name>.playback` becomes an exclusive 16 kHz, signed 16-bit stereo PCM
sink:

```text
PCM5102A VCC -> module-rated supply   PCM5102A GND -> SolarOS GND
PCM5102A SCK -> GND                   PCM5102A BCK -> GPIO1
PCM5102A DIN -> GPIO2                 PCM5102A RCK -> GPIO3

expansion attach pcm5102 dac0 bck=gpio1 din=gpio2 rck=gpio3
audio device dac0
audio default dac0
aplay /audio/example.mp3
```

The example pins are the Waveshare board's runtime-safe expansion GPIOs. Mono
streams are duplicated to left and right. Volume is applied in software before
samples reach I2S. On current supported ESP32 and ESP32-S3 boards the driver
uses I2S1, leaving I2S0 available to onboard audio or composite video. The
PCM5102A output is line level: use a powered input or a suitable amplifier, not
a passive speaker. Stop playback before detaching; detach reports busy while
the playback stream is open. Run `audio default auto` after testing to restore
automatic output selection.

### PCM1808 I2S audio input

The driver makes the ESP32 the I2S clock master. Configure the PCM1808 mode
pins before power-up: `MD1=LOW`, `MD0=LOW` selects slave mode and `FMT=LOW`
selects 24-bit Philips I2S. Wire the driver MCLK signal to the module's SCKI or
SCK pin. The PCM1808 mode pins are hardware straps, not runtime driver GPIOs:

```text
PCM1808 +5V -> SolarOS 5V               PCM1808 3.3V -> SolarOS 3.3V
PCM1808 GND -> SolarOS GND
PCM1808 MD1 -> GND                      PCM1808 MD0 -> GND
PCM1808 FMT -> GND                      PCM1808 SCKI/SCK -> GPIO1
PCM1808 BCK -> GPIO2                    PCM1808 LRCK -> GPIO3
PCM1808 DOUT -> GPIO17

expansion attach pcm1808 adc0 mclk=gpio1 bck=gpio2 ws=gpio3 dout=gpio17
audio device adc0
arecord -d 5 -i adc0.capture /sdcard/pcm1808.wav
```

The example uses all four runtime-safe Waveshare expansion GPIOs. The driver
generates 4.096 MHz MCLK and 64 BCK cycles per 16 kHz stereo frame. It receives
the converter's 24-bit I2S slots, keeps the most-significant 16 bits, and
publishes `adc0.capture` as an exclusive signed 16-bit stereo PCM source. It
uses the board's runtime I2S controller (I2S1 on current ESP32-S3 profiles), so
it can coexist with fixed onboard audio on I2S0 but not with another attachment
that owns I2S1. Stop recording before detach. A raw PCM1808 circuit requires
the analog supply, digital supply, reference components, and input network from
the manufacturer reference design; follow the breakout's own supply markings
when using a module. Common modules expose separate `+5V` analog and `3.3V`
digital supply pins; both rails must be powered.

## Wiring Examples

### PCD8544 on ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1

```text
VCC -> 3V3        GND -> GND
CLK/SCLK -> GPIO12
DIN/MOSI -> GPIO11
CE/CS -> GPIO10   DC -> GPIO4   RST -> GPIO5

expansion attach pcd8544 lcd0 spi=spi0 cs=gpio10 dc=gpio4 reset=gpio5
display test lcd0
```

Wire a module backlight according to the module board and use suitable current
limiting when connecting it to 3V3.

### Waveshare 4.2-inch V2 e-paper on ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1

This driver is for the monochrome 400x300 V2 module with the UC8176-compatible
controller path, including driver-board revision 2.2. It is not the
red/black/white `(B)` module.

```text
VCC -> 3V3        GND -> GND
CLK -> GPIO12     DIN -> GPIO11
CS -> GPIO10      DC -> GPIO17
RST -> GPIO16     BUSY -> GPIO15

expansion attach ssd1683 epd0 spi=spi0 cs=gpio10 dc=gpio17 reset=gpio16 busy=gpio15
display test epd0
display mode epd0
display mode epd0 refresh=full
display mode epd0 refresh=fast
expansion detach epd0
```

BUSY is active high. `refresh=auto` is the default: it uses a full waveform for
the first changed frame, then refreshes only the framebuffer rectangle that
changed. After 19 partial updates it reinitializes the controller and performs
a full cleanup refresh. After each partial waveform, the driver synchronizes
the controller's current and previous RAM planes before accepting the next
frame. Unchanged frames are skipped. `refresh=fast` remains a
fast full-frame update. Detach sends the controller to deep sleep before it
releases the SPI and GPIO resources. E-paper is bistable, so the last image
remains visible.
Keep VCC and ESP32 logic at 3.3 V even though recent Waveshare driver boards can
also operate in a 5 V logic domain.
If `expansion detach epd0` reports that the device is busy, run `sessions` and
close the display session that owns `epd0` with `session close <id>` first.

### M5Stack Unit CardKB on ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1

CardKB uses a fixed I2C address of `0x5f`. Connect SDA and SCL to the pins of
the named I2C bus; the DevKit `i2c0` board definition supplies the exact pin
numbers shown by `expansion buses`.

```text
VCC -> 5V         GND -> GND
SDA -> I2C0 SDA   SCL -> I2C0 SCL

expansion attach cardkb cardkb0 i2c=i2c0 addr=0x5f
expansion devices
expansion detach cardkb0
```

Each I2C read returns one key value, or zero when no key is pending. Printable
characters, Enter, Escape, Tab, Backspace, Delete, and the four arrows feed the
shared SolarOS input path. CardKB reports one value after release, so host-side
key repeat is not available. Its values 128 through 175 are private Fn
combinations and are ignored instead of being confused with SolarOS logical
keys.

### RFM95W on ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1

The RFM95W is a 3.3 V device. Connect an antenna suitable for the module band
before transmitting.

```text
VCC -> 3V3        GND -> GND
SCK -> GPIO12     MISO -> GPIO13
MOSI -> GPIO11    NSS/CS -> GPIO4
RESET -> GPIO5

expansion attach rfm95 radio0 spi=spi0 cs=gpio4 reset=gpio5
radio status radio0
```

The module and driver support FSK, GFSK, MSK, GMSK, OOK, and LoRa. The default
LoRa profile is 868 MHz, 125 kHz bandwidth, SF7, coding rate 4/5,
CRC enabled, explicit headers, sync word `0x12`, and 13 dBm transmit power.
The matching built-in profile applies those settings as one operation:

```text
radio profile apply radio0 lora-eu868
radio send radio0 "hello from SolarOS"
radio recv radio0 5000
```

The built-in `meshcore-eu868` profile is specifically for MeshCore companion
operation in the EU868 region: 869.618 MHz, 62.5 kHz, SF8, coding rate 4/8,
a 32-symbol preamble, private sync word `0x12`, CRC, variable length, and
14 dBm. MeshCore always requires an explicit profile:

```text
job start meshcore radio0 meshcore-eu868
```

`gfsk-eu868` and `ook-eu868` are also built in. Change both ends of a link to
the same profile before exchanging packets. A custom set of settings can be
captured in one of eight persistent NVS user profiles:

```text
radio profile apply radio0 gfsk-eu868
radio config radio0 bitrate 9600
radio profile save radio0 gfsk-9600
radio profile show gfsk-9600
```

Applying a profile leaves the radio in standby and rolls back the complete
configuration and prior state if the driver rejects it. User profiles preserve
every common radio setting, including addressing. Built-in profiles are read-only.
Selecting MSK or GMSK sets the deviation to one quarter of the bitrate, giving
the required modulation index of 0.5. GFSK and GMSK enable Gaussian shaping
with BT=1.0.

FSK-family and OOK packet payloads are limited to 64 bytes by the modem FIFO;
LoRa payloads may contain up to 255 bytes. Fixed length zero selects the
FSK/OOK unlimited FIFO-stream mode used by services such as POCSAG.

The driver polls the radio status registers, so DIO0/IRQ is optional. An IRQ
binding can still be reserved for future interrupt-driven operation.

### SSD1306 or SH1106 on SolarTerm

```text
VCC -> 3V3        GND -> GND
SDA -> GPIO13     SCL -> GPIO14

i2c scan i2c0
expansion attach ssd1306 oled0 i2c=i2c0 addr=0x3c
display test oled0
```

Common modules answer at `0x3c` or `0x3d`. If the image is shifted two pixels
left with two uninitialized columns on the right, reattach it as SH1106:

```text
expansion detach oled0
expansion attach sh1106 oled0 i2c=i2c0 addr=0x3c
display test oled0
```

After an auxiliary display is attached, it can also host a shell session:

```text
session create shell oled0
```

## Quick reference

Inspect runtime-safe pins and buses before attaching hardware. Use the `io`
application or the `gpio`, `adc`, `pwm`, `i2c`, `spi`, `uart`, `bus`, and
`expansion` commands as documented here. Resource ownership prevents two
drivers, jobs, or sessions from claiming the same hardware concurrently.
