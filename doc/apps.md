# SolarOS Embedded Apps

This document covers foreground applications registered in SolarOS. Availability
depends on the selected firmware flavor and board capabilities. The `apps`
command shows the app set compiled into the running image.

Exit behavior:

- Display shell: `CTRL+ALT+DEL` exits foreground apps.
- Port shells: `Ctrl+]` exits foreground apps.
- `Alt+Tab` switches between resumable foreground sessions on display builds.

## aplay

Play audio files through the board audio output. WAV and MP3 are supported when
the audio package is compiled and the board has audio hardware.

Usage:

```text
aplay [-v volume] file.wav|file.mp3
```

Controls:

- App-exit key stops playback.

## arecord

Record microphone input to a WAV file. This requires the audio package and
board microphone hardware.

Usage:

```text
arecord [-d seconds] file.wav
```

Controls:

- App-exit key stops recording.

## chat

Two-pane chat client. The left pane lists channels, the right pane shows
conversation history, and the bottom line is the message/command input.

Usage:

```text
chat [gateway-url] [channel] [user] [token]
```

The background `chat-sync` job owns the transport connection, retries, joined
channels, and queued outbound messages. Start it explicitly with
`job start chat-sync`, just like `email-sync`. Closing or suspending `chat` does
not disconnect an already-running synchronizer. Incoming messages remain in the
shared bounded chat store and publish bounded notifications to the universal
inbox; reopening the app replays the retained store. With SD storage, full
messages are retained under `/.chat/messages.bin`. On internal flash, Chat
restores the compact message copy already retained in `/.inbox/messages.bin`,
so it consumes no second flash ring. Both backends deduplicate transport replays
by stable message identity and keep linked Inbox read state aligned.

Unlike `email-sync`, `chat-sync` takes no interval argument: it waits for Wi-Fi
and reconnects with exponential backoff while remaining in the running state.

`/connect [url]` updates the saved gateway and enables synchronization.
`/disconnect` pauses synchronization without stopping the job.

In-app commands:

```text
/help
/join channel
/leave [channel]
/delete [channel]
/connect [url]
/disconnect
/status
/quit
```

Controls:

- `Tab` changes focus between channel list, messages, and input.
- `Up`/`Down` navigate the focused pane or input history.
- `Enter` sends input or joins the selected channel.
- `Page Up`/`Page Down` scroll messages.
- `Esc` or app-exit key exits.

## clock

Full-screen graphical seven-segment clock, alarm countdown, and stopwatch.

Usage:

```text
clock
clock -a mm:ss
clock -s
```

Controls:

- In stopwatch mode, `Space` starts/stops.
- In stopwatch mode, any other ordinary key resets to zero.
- `Esc` or app-exit key exits.

## com

Serial terminal for the expansion UART. Display-keyboard or port-shell input is
forwarded to the UART, and UART RX is drawn in the active terminal.

Usage:

```text
com [bus]
```

The bus defaults to `uart0`. For example, `com gps` connects to an existing
runtime UART bus named `gps`. The selected bus remains leased by the app until
the session exits. `com` works from both display and port shells; when launched
from a port shell, its terminal output is returned through that same port.

Controls:

- App-exit key exits.

## curl

HTTP client for quick text downloads and diagnostics. It can print response
data to the terminal or save it to a file.

Usage:

```text
curl [-L] [-o file] URL
```

Controls:

- App-exit key cancels an active transfer.

## edit

Text editor for files on mounted storage. It supports cursor navigation,
selection, clipboard operations, text-size changes, and syntax highlighting for
known source files. The editor supports files up to 256 KiB on boards with
PSRAM and 32 KiB on boards without PSRAM.

Usage:

```text
edit <file>
```

Controls:

- Arrows move the cursor.
- `Ctrl+Left`/`Ctrl+Right` move by words.
- `Shift+Arrows` extend selection.
- `Ctrl+A`, `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+X`, `Ctrl+V` select all, copy, cut, and paste.
- `Ctrl++` and `Ctrl+-` adjust editor text size for the active session.
- `Esc` saves if needed and exits; app-exit key exits.

## files

Two-pane file manager inspired by Midnight Commander. It is intended for quick
copy, move, delete, and launch workflows on mounted storage.

Usage:

```text
files [path]
```

Controls:

- Arrows navigate panes.
- `Tab` switches active pane.
- `Enter` opens directories or launches known files.
- File operations refresh both panes after completion.
- App-exit key exits.

## inbox

Universal incoming-message browser for pages, chat notifications, mail, and
other background producers. It reads the same shared inbox that supplies the
status-bar unread count. Messages and read state survive reboot in the bounded
`/.inbox/messages.bin` store; the service retains at most 64 entries and keeps
the file below 32 KB even when internal flash is the only storage.

Each list item occupies exactly one terminal row: unread/priority markers,
local reception date and time, a compact source (`chat/general`, `email`, or
`pocsag`), and as much of the message body preview as fits the screen.

Usage:

```text
inbox
```

Controls:

- `Up`/`Down`, `Page Up`/`Page Down`, `Home`, and `End` navigate.
- `Enter` or `Right` opens the selected message and marks it read.
- `Left`, `Backspace`, or `Esc` returns from a message to the list.
- `u` toggles the unread-only filter.
- `m` toggles the selected message between read and unread.
- `r` refreshes and `q` or the app-exit key exits.

## email

Receive-only IMAPS client for the configured mailbox. The app shows the
provider-specific message list while every newly synchronized message is also
published to the universal inbox and its shared status-bar unread counter.

Configure and synchronize the account before opening the app:

```text
wifi on
email configure imaps://imap.example.com user@example.com app-password INBOX
email sync
email
```

Controls:

- `Up`/`Down`, `Page Up`/`Page Down`, `Home`, and `End` navigate.
- `Enter` or `Right` opens the selected message and marks its universal inbox
  notification read.
- `Left`, `Backspace`, or `Esc` returns from a message to the list.
- `u` toggles the unread-only filter.
- `m` toggles the selected message between read and unread.
- `r` refreshes and `q` or the app-exit key exits.

The account configuration persists in NVS. The local message list is volatile
and keeps the newest 32 synchronized messages. This first version displays a
best-effort text preview; MIME attachments, encoded headers, sending, and
server-side read flags are not implemented yet.

## io

Interactive expansion I/O manager. It presents the board's expansion pins,
named buses, and resource claims in one TUI and uses the same ownership and
validation services as the `gpio`, `i2c`, `spi`, `uart`, `onewire`, and
`expansion` commands.

Usage:

```text
io
```

Controls:

- `Tab`, `Left`, and `Right` switch between Pins, Buses, and Claims.
- Arrows, Page Up/Page Down, Home, and End navigate the selected view.
- `Enter` opens context-sensitive actions for a pin or bus.
- `n` creates a board-approved named I2C, SPI, UART, or 1-Wire bus.
- Bus creation uses arrows to select fields and values; the generated bus name
  can be edited directly.
- Runtime buses can be attached, detached, or removed when their lease state
  permits it. Their `Autostart` action idempotently appends the matching
  `expansion bus create ...` command to `/.shell/startup`. Direct GPIO and PWM
  assignments can be created and released from the Pins view.
- `r` refreshes; `q`, `Esc`, or the app-exit key exits.

## invaders

Graphical arcade shooter.

Usage:

```text
invaders
```

Controls:

- `Left`/`Right` move the ship.
- `Space` or `f` fires.
- `Esc` or app-exit key exits.

## irriga

Graphical front-end for the irrigation controller. It shows the clock and all
zone states live, and edits schedules, zone count, mode, and the RTC. The
schedule engine itself runs as the `irrigd` background job; the app is only a
viewer/editor, so exiting it never changes relay outputs.

Usage:

```text
irriga
```

Controls:

- Home: `Up`/`Down`/`Left`/`Right` select a zone (the dashed focus frame
  appears on the first key press and hides 5 seconds after the last one),
  `Enter` opens the zone editor, `Space` toggles the zone's manual switch,
  `m` toggles auto/manual mode, `s` opens settings, `Esc` exits.
- Zone editor (Casio style): the zone's four slots on the left with the
  edited field inverted; `Left`/`Right` (or NEXT) walk the fields --
  start/end time, weekday toggles, active flag -- across all slots,
  `Up`/`Down` (or +1/-1) adjust, `Enter` (or SET) commits the zone, `Esc`
  (or BACK) returns without committing pending edits.
- Settings: zone count and mode with `Left`/`Right`, `Enter` on "Set clock"
  opens a manual RTC editor for offline sites (weekday is derived
  automatically).

On boards with the FT6336 touch panel (M5Stack Core2/CoreS3) the app is also
tap-driven: tapping a zone's lettered button or panel on the home screen
opens its editor, and the editor's BACK/SET/NEXT/+1/-1 buttons and slot rows
respond to taps. Touch assumes the default landscape orientation.

## less

Terminal pager for text files. It preserves original text layout and is useful
for quick file inspection.

Usage:

```text
less <file>
```

Controls:

- `Up`/`Down` or `j`/`k` scroll one line.
- `Page Up`/`Page Down`, `b`, or `Space` page.
- `Home`/`End` or `g`/`G` jump to start/end.
- `/` starts search, `n`/`N` repeat search.
- `q`, `Esc`, or app-exit key exits.

## logic

On-device logic analyzer waveform viewer. It displays the latest capture made
by the shared logic analyzer service or the SUMP job. With pin arguments it
makes a new local capture before opening the viewer.

Usage:

```text
logic
logic <pin[,pin...]> [rate-hz] [samples]
```

Examples:

```text
logic
logic 1,2,3,17
logic 1,2 500000 8192
```

Controls:

- Left/Right pans through the capture.
- `+`/`-` or Page Up/Page Down changes the time scale.
- `r` captures again with the current local configuration when the SUMP job is
  stopped.
- `a` or Home shows the complete capture.
- `q`, Esc, or the app-exit key exits.

The app is compiled only for boards with graphics and runtime-safe GPIOs. While
the SUMP job is running, the app remains a viewer and automatically reloads
captures received from the host.

## lua

Embedded Lua runtime. It can run an interactive REPL or execute `.lua` scripts
from storage. Lua scripts can use SolarOS service bindings when the selected
firmware includes the corresponding packages.

Usage:

```text

the shared SSH transport and host lookup/known-host storage.

Usage:

```text
scp [-P port] local [user@]host:remote
scp [-P port] local [user@]host:
scp [-P port] [user@]host:remote local
scp [-P port] [user@]host:remote-glob dir
scp [-P port] [user@]host:remote
```

Remote download paths can use `*` or `?`. The local target must be an existing
directory for remote wildcard downloads.

Controls:

- App-exit key cancels an active transfer.

## sheet

CSV viewer for small data tables. It is intended as a companion to `daq` logs
and simple spreadsheet-like inspection.

Usage:

```text
sheet <file.csv>
```

Controls:

- Arrows move through cells.
- Page keys scroll.

```

Controls:

- Most keys are sent to the remote host, including Esc, Alt+key, cursor keys,
  Ctrl combinations, and function keys.
- App-exit key closes the SSH app.
- `Alt+Tab` leaves the session running in the background on display builds.

## telnet

Telnet client for classic TCP terminal sessions. It supports basic Telnet
option negotiation, terminal type reporting, window size reporting, and raw mode.

```

Controls:

- Keyboard navigation follows the active web UI state.
- `Esc` or app-exit key exits.

## webradio

Internet radio player for MP3 streams, on the same audio pipeline as `aplay`.
A network task fills a PSRAM jitter buffer while the decode task plays from
it, so short network hiccups do not interrupt playback.
